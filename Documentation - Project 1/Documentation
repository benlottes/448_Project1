#Time Estimation Accounting
How we determined the time estimates of working on the project. 
-We created an excel sheet where members would clock in and out when the worked on the project. 
-This allowed us to have a detailed documentation of the hours that were put into the project. 
-As a team we made sure to hold meetings where we discussed updates and future task that needed to be complete. 
-We say work get done on the same day as the git brancehs were updated. 
-All of the hours reflect the amount of time that went into the project. 
-Making board(2 hours), player1 and player 2(3 hours), swapping tunrs (3 hours), hit/miss (6 hours), clicker event(6 hours), team meetings(10 hours)
-Total estimation: 30 hours
